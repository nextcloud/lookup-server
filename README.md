# Nextcloud Lookup-Server

## What is Lookup-Server?
The Lookup-Server is a server component that can be run independently from an Nextcloud Server. This Lookup-Server can be used by Nextcloud to find remote users that can be used for federated sharing. This is useful for autocompletion in the sharing dialog to get the federation ID.  Users can optionally decide to publish their sharing ID to be found by others. Think about it as a kind of public sharing telephone book.
