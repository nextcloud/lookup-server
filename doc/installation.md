# Installation

## System Requirements
* Linux Server
* Apache 2.4
* PHP 5.6 or newer
* MySQL

## Installation steps
1. Create a lookup MySQL database. Use the `mysql.dmp` for that.
1. Setup an Apache SSL/TLS vhost for the lookup server
2. Put the contents of the `server` subfolder in the vhost root.
4. Create a `config.php` file and adapt the settings. `config.sample.php` can be used as a template.
5. Make sure the config folder is not accessible from the internet by configuring Apache to respect the `.htaccess`
6. Add a cronjob that calls `replicationcron.php` every few minutes. Recommended is 10min.
7. Configure an automatic backup of the `mysql database` and the `vhost folder`.
8. Test the installation by executing the example curl commands listed in the [architecture.md](./architecture.md) file.

### Initialization of the lookup server database

On the database server, copy the [database dump file](../mysql.dmp) to initialize the database. Run `mysql -u username -p database_name < mysql.dmp` to import the dump in the database.

### Configuration of the webserver

Once the apache SSL/TLS vhost is ready, copy the content of the [server directory](../server) in the vhost root, e.g. `var/www/html` if using Apache defaults.

### Tune lookup server config.php

The main parameters to configure are:
- `DB` array (host, db, user, pass)
- `PUBLIC_URL` of the lookup server

If in a global scale setup, the following parameters are to set as well:
- `GLOBAL_SCALE` to `true`
- `AUTH_KEY` to a secure value

A full list of the parameters available is accessible [there](../server/config/config.sample.php).

### Configure Apache to respect the `.htaccess`

### Configure cronjob

The job that must run every 10 minutes for the lookup server is `replicationcron.php`, located in the webserver root.
If not familiar with cronjob, please refer to the Nextcloud official documentation [here](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/background_jobs_configuration.html#cron) about how to setup cronjobs.

**NB:** Note that you will have to replace `cron.php` by `replicationcron.php`.

### Configure the backups

For the configuration folder, instructions are similar to those for the Nextcloud server [here](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/maintenance/backup.html#backup-folders).

For the database, instructions are similar to those for the Nextcloud server [here](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/maintenance/backup.html#mysql-mariadb).

## Test the installation

### Test the connection between the webserver and the database

From the lookup server host, run:
```sh
mysql -h database_host -u username -p database_name -e "show databases;";
```

### Status endpoint
From the lookup server itself, query the status endpoint to check if the lookup server is running:
```sh
curl http://localhost/status
```
Result should be similar to: `{"version":"1.1.2"}`


### Test the network betwwen the lookup server and the Nextcloud servers

From the Nextcloud servers run:
```sh
curl https://lookup.example.com/status
```
Result should be similar to: `{"version":"1.1.2"}`


### Insert and query data
Other tests can be performed. Let's consider a JSON example:

```json
{
    "message": {
      "data": {
        "federationId": "foo@cloud.example.com",
        "name" : "Foo Bar",
        "email" : "foo@bar.com",
        "address" : "Foo Road 1",
        "website" : "example.com",
        "twitter" : "@foo",
        "phone" : "+1234567890"
      },
      "type" : "lookupserver",
      "timestamp" : 1337,
      "signer" : "foo@cloud.bar.com"
    },
    "signature" : "0ABCDDEE...."
}
```

On the lookup server, create a json file, and paste the content above:

```sh
nano testuser.json
```

Then, run the following to insert data into the lookup server directory:

```sh
# instert data in the lookup database
curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer lookup" -d @testuser.json https://lookup.example.com/users
```

Check the data has been inserted with:

```sh
# search for a user
curl -v -X GET https://cloud.example.com/users?search=foo
```

Result should be similar to:

```
[snip]
[{"federationId":"foo@cloud.example.com","name":{"value":"Foo Bar","verified":0},"email":{"value":"foo@bar.com","verified":0},"userid":{"value":"foo","verified":0}}]
```

More details about testing and the lookup server APIs is available [here](./architecture.md).

## Operations
* It is recommended to activate the logfile and monitor the activity at the beginning to make sure everything works
* There is an additional replication logfile. This should also be monitored to make sure everything works
* Regular Backups are strongly recommended
* github.com/nextcloud/lookup-server should be checked regulary to make sure all security updates are installed

### Enable the logfiles

Create a file owned by the user running the webserver, e.g. `sudo -u www-data touch /var/log/lookupserver.log`

In `/var/www/html/config/config.php`, set `LOG` to `/var/log/lookupserver.log`.

Do the same for the replication log file.

### Check for updates

To date, there is no automatic updates checks for the lookup server, so make sure you regularly check this repository to check for updates.
